# DetiInteract
Kiosk app developed during my MSc.

Allows a user to connect to the app with an android device, and navigate the contents of the app. The android app streams data over bluetooth which encodes common gestures (scroll, pinch zoom, gyro data) and each page responds appropriately.

Kios app contains:
- List of teachers: Allows the user to view a list of all teachers in the department, and check out their webpage.
- Schedule: Fetches all the classes in the department and displays them in a schedule, grouped by degree and year.
- Google Earth map: Lets the user pan and zoom.
- XNA 3d Model viewer: Loads a 3D model and locks it to the connected phone's gyro.
